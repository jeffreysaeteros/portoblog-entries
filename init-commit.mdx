**A Portoblog**
I am finally starting something I've been meaning to do for a while. It may sound silly but a portfolio + a blog should be something I should have a made a while back but I never thought it was necessary as a developer for some reason.

But here it is. It may be uninteresting to many reading this, but I think this would be a cool space to just post whatever I am into at the moment of writing (typing).

Creating this portfolio was fun even if it looks simple. But I finally put my dev chops to work for me instead of other things.

Here's an init commit
